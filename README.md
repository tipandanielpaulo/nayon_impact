# Nayon Web App for Impact Hackathon 2020 by Team Kalinaw
Team Kalinaw is establishing an online web application and service that provides open access to agricultural data reports for would-be farmers while guiding them to transitioning their investments towards agriculture. This is done by providing on-field, hands-on farming experience, and direct farming articles to our platform subscribers, by partnering up with farmers and farming communities. In return, our platform subscribers will have the ability to choose what to farm and to which farming community they will be immersed into with the guidance of the NAYON team and agricultural experts.
